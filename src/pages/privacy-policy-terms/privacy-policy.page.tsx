        </Body.Title>

        <Body.Text>
          The Internet is generally not regarded as a secure environment, and
          information sent via the Internet (such as to or from the Black Banx
          Website or via electronic message) may be accessed by unauthorized
          third parties, potentially leading to disclosures, changes in content
          or technical failures. Even if both sender and receiver are located in
          the same country, information sent via the Internet may be transmitted
          across international borders and be forwarded to a country with a
          lower data protection level than exists in your country of residence.
          Please note that we accept no responsibility or liability for the
          security of your information whilst in transit over the Internet to
          Black Banx. In order to protect your privacy we would like to remind
          you that you may choose another means of communication with Black
          Banx, where you deem it appropriate.
